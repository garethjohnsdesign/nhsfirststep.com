why-text: "Contacting your local maternity unit as soon as you find out you are pregnant
  will ensure you are offered all available services during your pregnancy. You will
  also receive the most up to date information, reassurance and mutual support at
  the start of your journey. \n\nIdeally you should make contact with a midwife before
  10 weeks of pregnancy. This is because some tests cannot be carried out later in
  pregnancy, for example the test for sickle cell and thalassaemia can only be carried
  out prior to 10 weeks.\n\nYour pregnancy will be treated confidentially, even if
  you are under 16.\n\n**For further information you can find your local maternity
  services here.**"

when-header: When can you take a pregnancy test?
when-text: |-
  You can carry out most pregnancy tests from the first day of a missed period. If you don't know when your next period is due, take the test at least 21 days after you last had unprotected sex.

  Some very sensitive pregnancy tests can be used even before you miss a period, from as early as eight days after conception.
when-extra-text: "You can take a pregnancy test on a sample of urine collected at
  any time of the day. It doesn't have to be in the morning.\n\nFor more information
  you can find \x03your local maternity services here."
