why-header: "Why make\x03 contact early?"
why-text: "Contacting your local maternity unit as soon as you find out you are pregnant
  will ensure you are offered all available services during your pregnancy. You will
  also receive the most up to date information, reassurance and mutual support at
  the start of your journey. \n\nIdeally you should make contact with a midwife before
  10 weeks of pregnancy. This is because some tests cannot be carried out later in
  pregnancy, for example the test for sickle cell and thalassaemia can only be carried
  out prior to 10 weeks.\n\nYour pregnancy will be treated confidentially, even if
  you are under 16."
